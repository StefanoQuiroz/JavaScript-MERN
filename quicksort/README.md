# Quick Sort

Implement the quik sort sorting algorithm.

Bonus:
1. Pivot = If we start by placing an extreme left element, we would have to compare and make successive swaps and the cost of these operations will be O(n^2).
2. Big O (worst-case) => O(n^2).
3. Big Omega (best-case)  => O(n) 
   Big Theta (average-case) => O(n log n)  
   QuickSort: Is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which sorts the elements of an unordered array.
